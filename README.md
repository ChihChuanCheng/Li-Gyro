# Li-Gyro Open Source
## Introduction
Li-Gyro is a flight controller which supports light-weight self-stablization aircraft[^1]. It is powered by a 1s li-po battery (4.2v). Figure 1 shows the configuration of Li-Gyro flight controller. It is featured by ESP8266 micro processor, and thus can be connected via WiFi. With equipped by an external antenna, the communication range can reach up to 100 meters, which has been verified in many field tests. It is also featured by MPU6050 to enable self-stablization for aircraft. It allows beginners to enjoy this hobby. Regarding actuators, Li-Gyro is equipped by 2 DC motors and 2 servos. It is thus suitable for aircraft with differential thrust, fixed wing aircraft, and delta wing with mixture control. Finally, it has flash mode to enable flexibility for hobbists to customize their own flight controller.
Regarding transmitters, Li-Gyro can be directly controlled by smartphone with V7RC installed ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.v7idea.v7rcliteandroidsdkversion&hl=zh_TW&gl=US), [iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/tw/app/v7rc/id1390983964)). Alternatively, it can also be controlled by Gamepad.

## Introduction to open sources
### Receiver
#### Li-Gyro flight controller
Li-Gyro is the open source for Li-Gyro flight controller. It mainly receives control commands (encoded with V7RC protocol) transmitted from smartphone or gamepad, adjusts control commands based on current orientation of the aircraft, and configure adjusted control commands to motors.
### Transmitter
#### V7RC app
V7RC app is introduced in [V7RC](https://hackmd.io/@accomdemy/v7rc).
#### V7RC gamepad
To allow gamepad to connect to V7RC app (in gamepad mode) via bluetooth, which in turn connects to Li-Gyro via WiFi to deliver control command. In this way, gamepad is able to take the advantage of V7RC app for parameter adjustment, e.g, trimming.
#### WiFi gamepad
To allow gamepad to directly connect to Li-Gyro via WiFi. The advantage of this control mode is simplicity.

## Applications
**Wright Flyer (with differential thrust)**

**Hovercraft (with differential thrust)**

**Fixed wing aircraft**

**RC ornithopter**
